# Introduction

You're a web developer with a passion for the art world. You'd love to create a web page to showcase examples of art through the ages, but you're not sure what the best way to get images of art into your web page. That's where APIs come in! In this module you'll learn the basics of APIs that help you get images of artwork made public by museums around the world.

What is an API? It seems like this is a term that gets used for many different things. Starting from a definition of the acronym, API stands for 'Application Programming Interface'. It's easiest to think of an API as a set of rules, or a codified handshake, between systems. 

Alternately, you can think about an API as a 'kitchen sink', as Burke Holland says. A sink is an API between you, the consumer of water, and the pipes which deliver it to you. You don't need to know much about the pipe configuration, just that when you turn a handle, water comes out and you can use it. The API is a convenient place to interface between the user and the product. 

One example of an API is the [jQuery API](https://api.jquery.com/, which is a program that uses jQuery's library to ease the programmer's interaction between a browser and the DOM, the tree of objects that make up a web page. Another example is software that is created to allow you to access other people's programs in a clear, secure, and documented way, for example to access flight times from an airline database so that you can use that data in your own applications. 

Fundamentally, this handshake between systems allows you to build your own applications with the help of a system that allows you to easily use other systems to enhance your own.

APIs have traditionally been built using a variety of protocols, including the XML-based Simple Object Access Protocol ([SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)) and Representational State Transfer Protocol ([REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)). While SOAP is a powerful tool to send and receive messages between systems, REST, with its ability to return both XML and the popular JSON format, has emerged as a more common way to use internet-connected web services and HTTP calls to send and receive data from third-party connections. For this reason, you'll learn about building and using REST APIs in this module.  

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will learn about one type of API, a RESTful API, by building one yourself. You will also learn various strategies in connecting to external APIs. Your task: to discover art and design by querying two different museum's public APIs.

## Prerequisites

You will need an internet-connected web browser such as Edge, and NPM and Node.js installed locally.
